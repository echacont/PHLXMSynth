# PHLXM Sequencer-Synthesizer

PHLXM is a synth Frankenstein, built on top of the Arduino platform 
(UNO, MEGA2540). Synthesis is done by [DREAM's SAM2695] (https://www.dream.fr/pdf/Serie2000/SAM_Datasheets/SAM2695.pdf), found on the [Fluxamasynth shield] (https://moderndevice.com/products/fluxamasynth-shield). Control is achieved by the third story in this stack the [MIDI Shield] (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12898) from SparkFun Electronics. Display is done on a cheap 16x2 LCD module.
